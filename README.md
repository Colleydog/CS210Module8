# CS210Module8
 Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  The project took in an input file and displayed the number of times a particular item was listed in the file.
   It used a combination of Cpp and Python
  
What did you do particularly well?
  The using of the CPP functions used to call the python functions
  
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  This code was supposed to call a function that took the results of the program and send the output to an output file. I would look more into doing that. I was having a   hard time getting that to work. The setup process for Python was finicky. So, going forward I will be researching things that could go wrong.
  
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  The code most challenging for me to write was the output file. I tried to write a function to accomplish this using C++ and Python, but it never seemed to connect t  the output file. I have a feeling it's the way I set up the output because I can get the output to work with a C++  program with only C++ but not combined with Python.
  
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or coursework?
  The most useful thing about this coding assignment is knowing what is possible with code. Before this assignment, I wasn't aware that you could code using two languages within one program. This makes me excited to learn more about code. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  The code is maintainable because of the functions used to call for an action to be done. The code is readable with the comments although I need to work on my commenting ability with industry standards and concise explinations. I sometimes don't know how much information is needed and then feel like I've entered too much information.
